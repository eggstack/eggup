# Changelog

## Unreleased

- M002 distribution schema corrective: TOML v1 templates now use a strict
  lexer that rejects malformed/stray/nested braces and unsupported syntax at
  parse time. Expanded release assets and checksum sidecars share a unique
  namespace, and expanded install names are unique; exact and ASCII-case-only
  collisions fail with a bounded typed error. No publication or consumer
  migration performed.

- M004 acquisition corrective: `FetchLimits::validate` is shared by its
  constructor and re-run at every fixture/Eggfetch transport boundary while
  public fields remain source-compatible for 0.1.x. Invalid direct literals
  fail before transport work. No-clobber hard-link creation is now the
  promotion commit point; redundant temp-link cleanup is best-effort and
  cannot return ordinary failure after a complete destination exists. No
  publication performed.

- M002 Unix service adapters (`eggup-service` capability): `SystemdManager`,
  `LaunchdManager`, and `CronManager` on the closed M001 contract with
  bounded literal-argv command execution (no shell, kill/reap, output
  bounds, fake executor), exact ownership (ambiguous outputs yield
  `Unknown`, foreign never mutated), atomic definition writes, cron
  byte-preservation, explicit privilege/scope handling (no sudo, no EUID
  guessing), and host fact vs candidate-policy separation. No consumer
  migrated; manager-specific types are new 0.1.x API. No publication
  performed.

- M001 distribution schema (new `eggup-dist` release-time crate, TOML v1):
  versioned `DistributionContract` with direct/bundle/archive asset forms,
  unambiguous target/alias mappings, small `{product}/{version}/{target}/
  {alias}(/{asset} for sidecars)` template expansion, explicit SHA-256
  sidecar naming (integrity only), and traversal-free archive member
  validation. Fixtures prove simple, CodeGG-like bundle, and Egress-like
  archive layouts. No runtime crate depends on `eggup-dist`; no network,
  extraction, or installer generation. Serialization choice: TOML (readable
  in review, clean for tagged `direct|bundle|archive` via explicit `kind`
  tables). No publication performed.

- M003 acquisition corrective (patch, no signature break): authoritative
  `min(request, adapter ceiling)` effective timeouts via Eggfetch
  request-level overrides; `FetchLimits::new` and adapter construction now
  require `connect <= total`; exclusive owner-private (`0600` Unix)
  temp siblings with bounded collision retry and no symlink following;
  race-safe no-clobber artifact promotion (existing/raced `dest` fails
  explicitly, never overwritten); owned-temp-only cleanup; category-only
  transport diagnostics (no upstream/proxy error echo, userinfo/query/
  fragment redaction). Eggsact (10s/120s) unchanged; stegoeggo total
  tightens 120s -> 60s (request wins). Version decision: next release is
  workspace lockstep 0.1.1 patch (acquisition + eggfetch fix, no API break);
  publish order seam-then-adapter when directed. No publication performed.

- Added the Rust 1.89 `eggup-core` workspace foundation and deterministic test
  fixture support.
- Documented the transport-neutral ownership boundary. No production updater
  behavior is included yet.
- Added validated private staging, synchronous commit/rollback receipts, native
  SHA-256 integrity checks, and bounded candidate validation phases.
- M005 corrective (breaking pre-1.0): canonical `Absent | Owned | Foreign |
  Unknown` ownership with consumer verifier and absent-create policy; no
  automatic destination-parent creation; staged-digest revalidation under lock;
  removed unenforced authenticity API; renamed cleanup disposition to
  `CleanupDisposition`; structured failure phase/category/member reports with
  real recovery paths; owner-private stage/backup/lock permissions with
  collision-resistant names and ownership-checked cleanup; truthful
  fail-closed lock inspection with no automatic stale removal; checksum-only
  docs.
- M006 qualification: `eggup-core` package metadata (keywords, categories,
  homepage, docs URL, exclude rules); `#[non_exhaustive]` on extensible enums;
  five runnable examples (one-member, multi-member, custom validator,
  ownership verifier, receipt interpretation); `cargo package` and `publish
  --dry-run` green; `eggup-core` crates.io name verified available;
  dependency surface remains `sha2` only; MSRV 1.89 and platform lanes
  documented. No publication performed.
